      <description>Hi,I&#39;m Debanwita, a 3rd year B-Tech undergrad, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar.
Recently, my interests leaning towards Web Development and Machine Learning (primaryly, Deep Learning). Curently following this wonderful course and the mandatory ebook.
I practice DSA on Leetcode and dabble in generative code (math pretty).
I read(and sometimes write) fiction, primarily fantasy and sci-fi, listen to rock and inhale netflix for survival. I&#39;m currently reading To Hold Up The Sky and The Song of Achilles.</description>

      <description>Structuring the siteI was (still am, honestly) debating whether I should make the site data centric or portfolio centric and mulling over its overall structuring. Data centric in the sense I&#39;d put more effort on blogs and less on ornamental css. Portfolio centric would&#39;ve called for more effort into the presentation of the site (putting my sweet p5.js and three.js skills to use) for the sake of creating a frontend portfolio.</description>
